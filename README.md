# Renewable-Energy-Forecasting-for-Integrated-Smart-Grid
Problem statement: Smart India Hackathon 

Approach: 
The solution requires the simulation of a micro-grid/utility system. This is followed by developing energy generation forecasting models using Statistical/Machine Learning Methods.(Done using Long-Short term memory networks(LSTMs)). Then we need to develop a scheduling system for the utility/micro-grid controller using well characterized optimization algorithms (Done by using the convex Optimization algorithm module Cvxpy). The final step is integratimg the forecasting model and scheduler with the simulation setup which could finally be deployed as a web application so that an Integrated Smart Grid utility manager could remotely monitor the operations of the deployed system in real-time.
