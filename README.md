# Renewable-Energy-Forecasting-for-Integrated-Smart-Grid
Problem statement: Smart India Hackathon 2020

Approach: 
1. Simulation of a micro-grid/utility system. 
2. Developing energy generation forecasting models using Statistical/Machine Learning Methods.(Done using Long-Short term memory networks(LSTMs) and Vector Auto Regression (VAR) - code provided). 
3. Developing a scheduling system for the utility/micro-grid controller using well characterized optimization algorithms (Done by using the convex Optimization algorithm module Cvxpy - code provided). 
4. The final step is integratimg the forecasting model and scheduler with the simulation setup which could finally be deployed as a web application so that an Integrated Smart Grid utility manager could remotely monitor the operations of the deployed system in real-time.
