# Renewable-Energy-Forecasting-for-Integrated-Smart-Grid
Problem statement: Smart India Hackathon 

STEP 1. Simulated a micro-grid/utility system.  
STEP 2. DevelopING energy generation forecasting models using Statistical/ Machine Learning Methods. 
STEP 3. Developed a scheduling system for the utility/micro-grid controller using well char-acterized optimization algorithms. 
STEP 4. Integrated the forecasting model and scheduler with the simulation setupwhich could finally be deployed as a web application so that an Integrated Smart Grid utility manager could remotely monitor the operations of the deployed system in real-time
